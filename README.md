## Predicting cosmological parameters using the weak lensing observable

The main file is "summer_nb.ipynb".

Future Work
1) Look carefully the cosmic shear power spectrum, because of the magnitude orders of the covariance matrix
2) Find the constants (understanding it!) and order of magnitude expected for important components of the fisher matrix
3) Define appropiate Shot Noise
4) Study the effect of intrinsic alignment power spectrum
5) Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.
